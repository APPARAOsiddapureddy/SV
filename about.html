                <span style="color:rgb(216, 29, 29);font-size: 35px;">"Mise-en-scene"</span> is a term used in film and theatre to describe the arrangement of everything that appears in the frame or on the stage. 
                It encompasses elements such as the setting, props, lighting, costumes, and the positioning and movement of actors.
                The term comes from French, where it literally means "placing on stage." In film, mise-en-scene is used to create a visual atmosphere that can help to convey the story and mood of the film. 
                For example, a film set in a dark, eerie forest might use low-key lighting and close-up shots to create a sense of danger and foreboding.

                In theatre, mise-en-scene is used to create a sense of the world that the characters inhabit. This might involve designing the stage set, selecting costumes, and blocking the movements of the actors. 
                A well-executed mise-en-scene can transport the audience to another time and place, and help them to connect with the characters and story.
                Overall, the term mise-en-scene refers to the deliberate arrangement of visual elements to create a certain look or atmosphere. It is an important part of film and theatre production, and can have a significant impact on the way that audiences experience a work of art.

                <br><br> It is not typically used as a name for a film club or organization. However, if the IIIT Sricity film club has chosen to use the name "Mise-en-scene" as their club name,
                it may be because they are interested in exploring the various elements that make up a film's mise-en-scene, such as lighting, composition, and costume design.
